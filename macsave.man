NAME
     macsave - Save Mac files read from standard input

SYNOPSIS
     macsave [ - options ]

DESCRIPTION
     _m_a_c_s_a_v_e reads a sequence of Macintosh MacBinary  files  from
     standard  input  and writes the files it contains subject to
     the _o_p_t_i_o_n_s specified.

OPTIONS
     In the absence of any options, _m_a_c_s_a_v_e reads standard  input
     and  silently  writes  the  file(s) it contains in MacBinary
     format, giving the output files ".bin" extensions and  plac-
     ing  them  in the current working directory.  Subdirectories
     are created for embedded folders.

     -3   Write files in fork  format  (.info,  .data  and  .rsrc
          files.)

     -f   As -3, but empty data and rsrc files are not created.

     -r   Write resource forks only (.rsrc files.)

     -d   Write data forks only (.data files.)

     -u   As -d, but the codes for CR and  LF  are  interchanged,
          the filename extension is .text.

     -U   As -u, but there is no filename extension.

     -a   Write files in AppleShare format.  This option is  only
          valid  if the program is compiled with support for some
          form of AppleShare.  The current directory  must  be  a
          valid AppleShare folder.

     -s   Write extracted files to standard output  in  MacBinary
          format.

     -l   List every file extracted (and  every  directory/folder
          created etc.)

     -v   Like -l, but more verbose (implies -l.)

     -i   Do not extract, give information only (implies -l.)

     -q   Ask the user for every file/folder whether it should be
          extracted (implies -l.)

     -V   Gives the patchlevel of the program, and other informa-
          tion.   Other options are ignored and the program quits
