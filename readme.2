t1utils is a collection of simple type-1 font manipulation programs.
Together, they allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB
(binary) formats, disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable
form, reassemble them into PFA or PFB format.  Additionally you can
extract font resources from a Macintosh font file (ATM/Laserwriter).

There are currently five programs:

t1ascii     converts PFB files to PFA format.

t1binary    converts PFA files to PFB format.

t1disasm    disassembles a type-1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a
                raw, human-readable text form for subsequent hand
                editing, tweaking, hint fixing, etc...

t1asm       assembles type-1 font into PFA or PFB format from raw,
                human-readable text form.

unpost      extracts POST resources from a Macintosh type-1 file
                (ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use
                outside the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file
                should be stored in MacBinary format or as a raw
                resource fork.  Note that unpost does not have to run
                on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh type-1 fonts
                available to Unix machines and PCs.

These programs have been originally developed on a Sun4 (SPARC)
using both acc and gcc by I. Lee Hetherington (ilh@lcs.mit.edu).

Kai-Uwe Herbing (herbing@netmbx.netmbx.de), have ported this
utility collection to the Microsoft C/C++ Compiler Version 7.00
and compiled them for the MS-DOS operating system.

John Paul Morrison (jmorriso@ee.ubc.ca) ported this to OS/2 2.0
for use with the GNU/EMX compiler.

Note that these tools should not be used to illegally copy type-1 font
programs.  Typeface design is an intricate art that should be
rewarded.

The original version numbers of the ported programs are:
        t1ascii     1.1     t1binary    1.1
        t1disasm    1.2     t1asm       1.2
