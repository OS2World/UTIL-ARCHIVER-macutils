NAME
     macunpack - Macintosh file de-archiver

SYNOPSIS
     macunpack [ - options ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
     _m_a_c_u_n_p_a_c_k takes the Macintosh MacBinary archive specified in
     _f_i_l_e  (or  standard input if none is specified) and extracts
     the files it contains subject to the _o_p_t_i_o_n_s specified.  The
     program  will  also  accept the data fork of the archive for
     some kinds of archive as standard input.

OPTIONS
     In the absence of any options, _m_a_c_u_n_p_a_c_k takes the specified
     archive  and  silently extracts the file(s) it contains into
     MacBinary format, giving the output files ".bin"  extensions
     and  placing  them  in  the current working directory.  Sub-
     directories are created for embedded folders.

     -3   Write files in fork  format  (.info,  .data  and  .rsrc
          files.)

     -f   As -3, but empty data and rsrc files are not created.

     -r   Write resource forks only (.rsrc files.)

     -d   Write data forks only (.data files.)

     -u   As -d, but the codes for CR and  LF  are  interchanged,
          the filename extension is .text.

     -U   As -u, but there is no filename extension.

     -a   Write files in AppleShare format.  This option is  only
          valid  if the program is compiled with support for some
          form of AppleShare.  The current directory  must  be  a
          valid AppleShare folder.

     -s   Write extracted files to standard output  in  MacBinary
          format.

     -l   List every file extracted (and  every  directory/folder
          created etc.)

     -v   Like -l, but more verbose (implies -l.)

     -i   Do not extract, give information only (implies -l.)

     -q   Ask the user for every file/folder whether it should be
          extracted (implies -l.)

     -V   Gives the patchlevel of the program, and other informa-
          tion.   Other options are ignored and the program quits
          immediately.

          options are ignored and the program quits immediately.

BUGS
     As this is a beta release, there may still be some problems.
     Archives that are password protected and multi-file archives
     are not dealt with.
