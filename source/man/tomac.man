NAME
     tomac - Transmit files to the Mac

SYNOPSIS
     tomac [ - options ] [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
     _t_o_m_a_c takes the files specified in _t_o_m_a_c and transmits  them
     to  the Mac subject to the _o_p_t_i_o_n_s specified.  If _f_i_l_e_s also
     specifies directories they are followed recursively, and all
     files  found  will be transmitted.  If no _f_i_l_e_s parameter is
     specified, binhex reads a  MacBinary  stream  from  standard
     input  and  transmits the files found; folder information is
     lost.

OPTIONS
     In the absence of any options,  _t_o_m_a_c  takes  the  specified
     files and transmits them to to the Mac using the XMODEM pro-
     tocol.  Directories named in _f_i_l_e_s are followed recursively,
     all  files  found will be transmitted.  Files are assumed to
     be in MacBinary format.  However, if the filename ends  with
     .info the file is assumed to be the info fork of a MacIntosh
     file split amongst more than one file.   In  that  case  the
     files  with  .data  and  .rsrc  extensions are also read (if
     present).  Also, if the info fork is mentioned in the param-
     eter  list, the names of data and resource forks can also be
     mentioned, but those will  be  ignored  (this  is  to  allow
     wild-card  expansion by the shell.) Further, if some form of
     AppleShare is supported by the installed program, and if the
     current  directory,  or  one of the directories found during
     recursive processing, is a directory in the  format  of  the
     supported version of AppleShare, those files will be handled
     according to the properties of AppleShare.

     -r   No intelligent file-processing is performed; all  files
          named  are  assumed to be plain resource files, and are
          transmitted as if they were  MacIntosh  resource  files
          with  creator  "RSED"  and  type "RSRC", unless another
          creator and/or type are specified.

     -d   No intelligent file-processing is performed; all  files
          named  are  assumed  to  be  plain  data files, and are
          transmitted as if they were MacIntosh data  files  with
          creator  "MACA" and type "TEXT", unless another creator
          and/or type are specified.

     -u   As -d, but the codes for CR and LF are interchanged.

     -U   Is a synonym for -u.

     -c creator
          Defines the creator name to  be  used  if  one  of  the

          previous options is specified.

     -t type
          Defines the type name to be used if one of the previous
          options is specified.

     -l   List every file and directory processed.

     -i   Do not transmit files, give information  only  (implies
          -l.)

     -q   Ask the user for every file/directory whether it should
          be visited (implies -l.)

     -x   Use the XMODEM protocol for transmission.

     -y   Use the YMODEM protocol for transmission (not yet  sup-
          ported.)

     -z   Use the ZMODEM protocol for transmission (not yet  sup-
          ported.)

     -o   Use the pre-beta version of XMODEM.

     -T   Allow for time-out detection during the protocol.  Nor-
          mally  you  will  not need this option because on occa-
          sion, when network delays do occur, time-out  detection
          interferes  with  a  good transmission.  Also, when for
          some reason the connection is broken the  program  will
          normally  receive a hang-up signal and terminate.  How-
          ever, in some situations it might be necessary to early
          detect  time-outs  (because  of  communication  loss or
          whatever, without  loss  of  connection).   You  should
          check  whether  use  of this option has profits in your
          situation or not.

     -V   Gives the patchlevel of the program, and other informa-
          tion.   Other options are ignored and the program quits
          immediately.

     -H   Give  short  information  about  the  options.    Other
          options are ignored and the program quits immediately.

BUGS
     As this is a beta release, there may still be some problems.
