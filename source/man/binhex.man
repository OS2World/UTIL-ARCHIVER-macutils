NAME
     binhex - Hexifies a series of files

SYNOPSIS
     binhex [ - options ] [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
     _b_i_n_h_e_x takes the files specified in _f_i_l_e_s and hexifies  them
     in  BinHex  4.0  format  on  standard  output subject to the
     _o_p_t_i_o_n_s specified.  If _f_i_l_e_s also specifies directories they
     are  followed recursively, and all files found will be hexi-
     fied.  If no _f_i_l_e_s parameter is specified,  binhex  reads  a
     MacBinary  stream from standard input and hexifies the files
     found; folder information is lost.

OPTIONS
     In the absence of any options, _b_i_n_h_e_x  takes  the  specified
     files and silently hexifies them to BinHex 4.0 format, writ-
     ing the result to standard  output.   Directories  named  in
     _f_i_l_e_s are followed recursively, all files found will be hex-
     ified.  Files are assumed to be in MacBinary  format.   How-
     ever, if the filename ends with .info the file is assumed to
     be the info fork of a MacIntosh file split amongst more than
     one  file.   In  that  case  the  files with .data and .rsrc
     extensions are also read (if present).  Also,  if  the  info
     fork  is  mentioned in the parameter list, the names of data
     and resource forks can also be mentioned, but those will  be
     ignored (this is to allow wild-card expansion by the shell.)
     Further, if some form of  AppleShare  is  supported  by  the
     installed  program,  and if the current directory, or one of
     the directories found  during  recursive  processing,  is  a
     directory   in  the  format  of  the  supported  version  of
     AppleShare, those files will be  handled  according  to  the
     properties of AppleShare.

     -r   No intelligent file-processing is performed; all  files
          named  are  assumed to be plain resource files, and are
          hexified as if they were MacIntosh resource files  with
          creator  "RSED" and type "RSRC", unless another creator
          and/or type are specified.

     -d   No intelligent file-processing is performed; all  files
          named are assumed to be plain data files, and are hexi-
          fied as if they were MacIntosh data files with  creator
          "MACA"  and  type "TEXT", unless another creator and/or
          type are specified.

     -u   As -d, but the codes for CR and LF are interchanged.

     -U   Is a synonym for -u.

     -c creator

BINHEX(L)                LOCAL COMMANDS                 BINHEX(L)



          Defines the creator name to be used if one of the  pre-
          vious options is specified.

     -t type
          Defines the type name to be used if one of the previous
          options is specified.

     -R   Do not use run-length encoding during  the  conversion.
          This  option may speed up the encoding a bit, but it is
          merely a historical artifact.

     -l   List every file and directory processed.

     -i   Do not output files,  give  information  only  (implies
          -l.)

     -q   Ask the user for every file/directory whether it should
          be visited (implies -l.)

     -V   Gives the patchlevel of the program, and other informa-
          tion.   Other options are ignored and the program quits
          immediately.

     -H   Give  short  information  about  the  options.    Other
          options are ignored and the program quits immediately.

BUGS
     As this is a beta release, there may still be some problems.
