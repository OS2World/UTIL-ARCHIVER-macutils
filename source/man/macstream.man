NAME
     macstream - Convert a series of files to a MacBinary stream

SYNOPSIS
     macstream [ - options ] files

DESCRIPTION
     _m_a_c_s_t_r_e_a_m takes the files specified in  _f_i_l_e_s  and  combines
     them to a MacBinary stream on standard output subject to the
     _o_p_t_i_o_n_s specified.  If _f_i_l_e_s also specifies directories they
     are followed recursively, and all files found will be put in
     the MacBinary stream, together with directory information.

OPTIONS
     In the absence of any options, _m_a_c_s_t_r_e_a_m takes the specified
     files  and  silently  combines  them  to a MacBinary stream,
     writing the result to standard output.  Directories named in
     _f_i_l_e_s  are followed recursively, all files found will be put
     in the MacBinary stream, together  with  directory  informa-
     tion.   Files  are  assumed to be in MacBinary format.  How-
     ever, if the filename ends with .info the file is assumed to
     be the info fork of a MacIntosh file split amongst more than
     one file.  In that case  the  files  with  .data  and  .rsrc
     extension  are  also  read  (if present).  Also, if the info
     fork is mentioned in the parameter list, the names  of  data
     and  resource forks can also be mentioned, but those will be
     ignored (this is to allow wild-card expansion by the shell.)
     Further,  if  some  form  of  AppleShare is supported by the
     installed program, and if the current directory, or  one  of
     the  directories  found  during  recursive  processing, is a
     directory  in  the  format  of  the  supported  version   of
     AppleShare,  those  files  will  be handled according to the
     properties of AppleShare.

     -r   No intelligent file-processing is performed; all  files
          named  are  assumed to be plain resource files, and are
          written as MacIntosh resource files with creator "RSED"
          and type "RSRC", unless another creator and/or type are
          specified.

     -d   No intelligent file-processing is performed; all  files
          named are assumed to be plain data files, and are writ-
          ten as MacIntosh data files  with  creator  "MACA"  and
          type  "TEXT",  unless  another  creator and/or type are
          specified.

     -u   As -d, but the codes for CR and LF are interchanged.

     -U   Is a synonym for -u.

     -c creator
          Defines the creator name to  be  used  if  one  of  the

          previous options is specified.

     -t type
          Defines the type name to be used if one of the previous
          options is specified.

     -l   List every file and directory processed.

     -i   Do not output files,  give  information  only  (implies
          -l.)

     -q   Ask the user for every file/directory whether it should
          be visited (implies -l.)

     -V   Gives the patchlevel of the program, and other informa-
          tion.   Other options are ignored and the program quits
          immediately.

     -H   Give  short  information  about  the  options.    Other
          options are ignored and the program quits immediately.

BUGS
     As this is a beta release, there may still be some problems.
