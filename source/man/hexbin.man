HEXBIN(L)                LOCAL COMMANDS                 HEXBIN(L)



NAME
     hexbin - Macintosh file de-binhexer

SYNOPSIS
     hexbin [ - options ] [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
     _h_e_x_b_i_n takes the text files specified in _f_i_l_e_s (or  standard
     input if none is specified) and converts them subject to the
     _o_p_t_i_o_n_s specified.

OPTIONS
     In the absence of any options, _h_e_x_b_i_n  takes  the  specified
     files and silently converts them into MacBinary format, giv-
     ing the output files ".bin" extensions and placing  them  in
     the current working directory.

     -3   Write files in fork  format  (.info,  .data  and  .rsrc
          files.)

     -f   As -3, but empty data and rsrc files are not created.

     -r   Write resource forks only (.rsrc files.)

     -d   Write data forks only (.data files.)

     -u   As -d, but the codes for CR and  LF  are  interchanged,
          the filename extension is .text.

     -U   As -u, but there is no filename extension.

     -a   Write files in AppleShare format.  This option is  only
          valid  if the program is compiled with support for some
          form of AppleShare.  The current directory  must  be  a
          valid AppleShare folder.

     -s   Write extracted files to standard output  in  MacBinary
          format.

     -l   List every file extracted (and  every  directory/folder
          created etc.)

     -v   Like -l, but more verbose.  When this option is  speci-
          fied  all  lines  skipped because they do not belong to
          the hexified format are listed (implies -l.)

     -i   Do not convert, give information only (implies -l.)

     -c   Do not check whether  the  hexified  lines  have  equal
          size.   Normally  the  hexifiers  gives text files with
          equal length line size, hexbin uses this in its heuris-
          tics  to  determine  whether  a  line  must be skipped.

          There are however hexified files that do not conform to
          that  pattern.  If this option is specified hexbin will
          in general be unable to detect whether a line  is  gar-
          bage or not, so you have to remove the garbage by hand.

     -n name
          Gives the Unix base file name for the converted  files.
          For files hexified with BinHex 4.0 or compatible hexif-
          iers this flag is not needed; hexbin will determine the
          Unix  file  name based on the Mac file name.  For files
          in dl, hex or hcx format this parameter may  be  needed
          as these formats do not include the Mac filename.  Nor-
          mally hexbin will in those cases  base  the  Unix  file
          name  on  the text file name, but that can be overruled
          with this parameter.

     -V   Gives the patchlevel of the program, and other informa-
          tion.   Other options are ignored and the program quits
          immediately.

     -H   Give  short  information  about  the  options.    Other
          options are ignored and the program quits immediately.

BUGS
     As this is a beta release, there may still be some problems.
