NAME
     frommac - Receive files from the Macintosh

SYNOPSIS
     frommac [ - options ]

DESCRIPTION
     _f_r_o_m_m_a_c receives files from the Macintosh and processes them
     subject to the _o_p_t_i_o_n_s specified.

OPTIONS
     In the absence of any options,  _f_r_o_m_m_a_c  receives  a  single
     file  and  stores  it in MacBinary format, giving the output
     file ".bin" extensions and placing it in the current working
     directory.

     -3   Write files in fork  format  (.info,  .data  and  .rsrc
          files.)

     -f   As -3, but empty data and rsrc files are not created.

     -r   Write resource forks only (.rsrc files.)

     -d   Write data forks only (.data files.)

     -u   As -d, but the codes for CR and  LF  are  interchanged,
          the filename extension is .text.

     -U   As -u, but there is no filename extension.

     -a   Write files in AppleShare format.  This option is  only
          valid  if the program is compiled with support for some
          form of AppleShare.  The current directory  must  be  a
          valid AppleShare folder.

     -s   Write received files to standard  output  in  MacBinary
          format.

     -l   List every file received.

     -m   Receive multiple files.  Entering  ^X  (CNTRL-X)  after
          the last file will terminate the program.

     -x   Use the XMODEM protocol for transmission.

     -y   Use the YMODEM protocol for transmission (not yet  sup-
          ported.)

     -z   Use the ZMODEM protocol for transmission (not yet  sup-
          ported.)

     -o   Use the pre-beta version of XMODEM.

FROMMAC(L)               LOCAL COMMANDS                FROMMAC(L)



     -T   Allow for time-out detection during the protocol.  Nor-
          mally  you  will  not need this option because on occa-
          sion, when network delays do occur, time-out  detection
          interferes  with  a  good transmission.  Also, when for
          some reason the connection is broken the  program  will
          normally  receive a hang-up signal and terminate.  How-
          ever, in some situations it might be necessary to early
          detect  time-outs  (because  of  communication  loss or
          whatever, without  loss  of  connection).   You  should
          check  whether  use  of this option has profits in your
          situation or not.  Normally  when  transmission  errors
          did  occur entering a number of times ^X (CNTRL-X) will
          gracefully terminate the program.

     -V   Gives the patchlevel of the program, and other informa-
          tion.   Other options are ignored and the program quits
          immediately.

     -H   Give  short  information  about  the  options.    Other
          options are ignored and the program quits immediately.

BUGS
     As this is a beta release, there may still be some problems.
